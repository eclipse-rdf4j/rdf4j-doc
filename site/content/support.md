## Mailing List / Forum

There is an active rdf4j community that uses the **[rdf4j-users Google group]( https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rdf4j-users)** to communicate. You can [browse through the group messages](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rdf4j-users) without joining, but you’ll need to join the group to be able to post.

The rdf4j development team uses the [rdf4j-dev@eclipse.org mailinglist](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/rdf4j-dev) to discuss development progress.

## Reporting bugs and requests for improvement

If you think you’ve found a bug in rdf4j, or wish to log a request for a new feature or improvement, please use the [rdf4j issue tracker](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues). Before you add your new issue, though, please have a look around to see if it’s not already there.
